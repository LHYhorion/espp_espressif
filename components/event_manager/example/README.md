# Event Manager Example

This example shows some basic usage for the `EventManager` which allows
asynchronous communications between multiple tasks following the anonymous
pub/sub interaction pattern - supporting one to one, one to many, many to one,
and many to many data and event dissemination.

## How to use example

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
