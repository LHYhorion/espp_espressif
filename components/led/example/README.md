# LED Example

This example shows how to use the `espp::Led` class to control the LED using the
ESP32 hardware.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to be run on the M5Stack ESP32 Timer Cam (using its
LED). If you wish to run on other hardware, just make sure to set the GPIO that
you want to use in the code.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
