# Serialization Example

This example shows the use of the `serialization` component (and the `alpaca`
library it wraps) to perform robust and reliable binary serialization and
deserialization of arbitrary objects.

## How to use example

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
